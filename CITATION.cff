abstract: >-
  Vellvm is an ongoing project aiming at the formal
  verification in the Coq proof assistant of a compilation
  infrastructure inspired by the LLVM compiler.


  The central piece of Vellvm is the Verified IR (VIR), a
  Coq formalization of the semantics of (a subset of) the
  LLVM IR that is intended for formal verification of
  LLVM-based software. It is being developed at the
  University of Pennsylvania as part of the DeepSpec
  project.
