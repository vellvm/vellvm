# printf source

Here lives our current bare implementation of `printf`. 

### Overview

Our goal is to find the simplest implementation of `printf` in terms of external
library calls. So far, this has been the implementation for embedded systems by
[mpaland](https://github.com/mpaland/printf) and its more up-to-date fork by
[eyalroz](https://github.com/eyalroz/printf) on github. 

We tried several other versions of `printf.c`: the `glibc` implementation and
the `apple` implementation. These, however, both reference numerous external
libraries and even compiling them is a challenge. 

The main advantage of the embedded versions is that they rely on *extremely* few
external libraries: just `stdbool.h` and `stdint.h`. They print characters with
`putchar`; this could be modified to fit our `puts` structure. 

The current (embedded) implementation of `printf` lives in `printf-src`,
detailed in **Directory Structure** below. It is a modified version of 
[mpaland](https://github.com/mpaland/printf)'s `printf.c`. 

It builds with `clang -emit-llvm -S printf.c` with no warnings. 

I have made minimal modifications to the files in order to get them to compile
and for simplicity-- largely fixing include paths and making `_out_char` wrapper
call system `putchar` explicitly. 


### Directory Structure

`printf-src`: Where current source for our in-use implementation of `printf`
lives. The corresponding `printf.ll` is also included, as generated by `clang
-emit-llvm -S printf.c` with `clang` version 14.0.6.

I've added a `repo-link.md` which links directly to the original github
repository of embedded `printf` in case others want to take a look.
