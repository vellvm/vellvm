Section UpwardExposed.

  (** * Upward exposed
        A use site is said to be upward exposed if its def site is not in the
        same block, i.e. if the live range of the used variable escapes the block
        of the use site.
   *)
  (* Note: this definition is quite naive, it doesn't consider the relative position
       within the block of the def and use sites considered.
       I believe that it's correct in SSA form, but should be triple checked.

Section Block_Substitution.

  (* This definition expresses the local proof obligation
     required to justify the substitution of a block [b1]
     by another block [b2] in a context.
     Contrary to the case of equivalent expressions, the
     context will be constrained as well.
     We state that if:
     - the upward exposed local variables are the same set
     [scope] in both blocks.
     - the initial local states extensionally agree on [scope]
     then:
     - the blocks are bisimilar
     - they return local states that extensionally agree on

Section Liveness.

  (** * Liveness
      Data-flow approach, we compute for each block the [LiveIn] set of live variables when entering the block,
      and [LiveOut] set of live variables when entering a successor of the block.
      These sets can be characterized by the following set of recursive equations:
      LiveIn bk  ≡ defs bk.(blk_phis) +++ upward_exposed bk +++ (LiveOut bk ∖ defs bk)
      LiveOut bk ≡ (set_flat_map (fun bk' => LiveIn bk' ∖ defs bk'.(blk_phis)) (bk_outputs bk)) +++ uses bk.(blk_phis)
      In SSA form, the fixpoint can be directly computed in two passses over the CFG.
