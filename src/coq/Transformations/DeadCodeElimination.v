(* Interestingly, we cannot eliminate blocks marked as unreachable simply based on its semantics:

   b: external_call;;
      unreachable

   [unreachable] indicates that the end of the block is unreachable, not the block itself.
   The execution of the block above hence contains all behaviors starting with an
   external call, it does not contain the one consisting in refining it by eliminating it.
