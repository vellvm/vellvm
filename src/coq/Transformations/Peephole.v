Section Peephole.

  (* A peephole optimization is a program transformation substituting straight code for straight code *)
  (* NOTE: I'm running the optimization _after_ conversion of dtypes so that I can avoid converting them at various level.
     In the spirit of being able to emit valid IR source code, we should however do it before. That should just be more
     tedious, TODO.
   *)
  Definition peephole_optimization := code dtyp -> code dtyp.

  (* We lift this code-local transformation to a whole VIR program transformation *)
  (* NOTE: we need to actually also lift the elementary peephole optimization only defined
     on snippets of codes being transformed to general straight code.
     It is not completely obvious to me what is the right general approach to that, especially
     granted that it must also support lifting of the correctness of the transformation.
     It is however orthogonal to the crafting of the correctness condition allowing it to be
     lifted in arbitrary context, I'll therefore come back to it later.

Section DeadCodeElim.

  (* Dead code elimination is a global optimization: it relies on liveness information.
     Interestingly, we still want to phrase its definition and correctness locally.
     We should be able to assume a pre-computed liveness oracle whose correctness can
     be phrased in isolation.
